 * than to ExoPlayer directly means adding a track selector later is a change to the implementation
 * and one new method here, not a rewrite of the player screen and the guide's preview window.
 *
 * There is exactly one implementation alive at a time, and it owns exactly one ExoPlayer. That is
 * not an implementation detail: Xtream accounts are sold with a connection limit, commonly one, so
 * opening a second stream for the guide's preview window would get the user's account locked out.
 * The preview and the full-screen view share this instance.
