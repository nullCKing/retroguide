/**
 * The guide's cursor, as a pure state machine.
 *
 * Remote-control navigation is the part of a TV app that is easiest to get subtly wrong and
 * hardest to check by looking at a screenshot: the highlight moving one row too far, the window
 * failing to scroll at the edge, the user walking backwards into last week. Keeping it here, with
 * no Compose or Android types, means every rule in section 5.3 of the spec is an assertion.
 *
 * The cursor is identified by a channel index and an *anchor time* rather than by a programme id.
 * Anchoring on time is what makes Up and Down behave the way a cable guide does: moving down a
 * row keeps you at the same moment in the evening, landing on whatever that channel is showing
 * then, even though the programme boundaries do not line up between rows.
