/**
 * Assigns cable-style channel numbers in country blocks: US, then UK, then Japan, then South Korea.
 *
 * The property that matters is stability. A viewer learns that 1042 is their channel, and a
 * refresh that renumbers everything because the provider reordered its stream list would be worse
 * than useless. So numbers are keyed on `stream_id` and, once handed out, are never reassigned —
 * not even when a channel disappears. If it comes back a month later it gets its old number back.
 *
 * The cost of never reclaiming a number is that churn eats into a block. Each block is sized well
 * beyond any real provider's count for the countries involved, and [OVERFLOW_START] catches the
 * pathological case rather than colliding.
