.SYNOPSIS
    Creates the release signing keystore, once.

.DESCRIPTION
    Writes secrets/retroguide-release.jks and secrets/keystore.properties, both gitignored.

    THE SAME KEY MUST BE USED FOR EVERY BUILD. Android identifies an app by its package name and
    its signing certificate together, so an APK signed with a different key will not install over
    an existing one — the user has to uninstall first, losing their settings and channel list.
    Back this file up somewhere safe. If it is lost, there is no way to produce an update that
    installs over what is already on the device.

    Run once:  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\make-keystore.ps1
